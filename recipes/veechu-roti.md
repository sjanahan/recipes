### Why this Dish?
The first time I had this was in Canada with my Chithappa when I was 5 or 6 years old. The first time homemade was by Appachi! She made it when we visited her in Sydney. This recipe is by Kitchen Guerrilla, though.

### Tools
1. Massive mixing bowl
1. Towel (dampen and rest)
1. Cooling rack
1. Cast iron skillet

### Ingredients
1. 360g wheat flour ("all purpose" flour)
1. 6g salt
1. 14g oil
1. 14g coconut oil
1. 240g warm water
1. Extra oil for soaking

### Preparation
1. Weigh out the flour, baking powder, salt, oil, coconut, and water
1. Make sure the counter is clean for stretching!

### Steps
1. Mix dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) with coconut and oil
1. Add warm water
1. Knead for 10 minutes
    * Pull it back to you and push down with kunckle
    * Need to be sticky but not breaking apart
1. Create uniform balls (by stretching it on itself to create a clean skin) by weight
1. Submerge balls in oil for 1-2 hours
1. Remove dough from oil and flatten on counter until see through 
    * Don't worry if it tears a bit
1. Start cast iron skillet on medium heat, lower to medium low
1. Flip very often - you want it to stay pliant, not get crispy
1. Remove before it starts cracking
