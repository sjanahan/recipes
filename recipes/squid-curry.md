### Why this Dish?
Amma's KaNavaay Curry

If Amma never left Ilankai, how would my life be different?
Ilankai Janahan. What would he be like?

Would he love pizza?
Would he watch "90 Day Fiance?"
Would he have clumsy feet?
Would he grow up in a town with all of his family near by?
Would he play soccer on the beach at night with his friends?
Would he pine for a life he's never actually lived?
 
For all the questions there are, there's one thing I need not wonder about.
What if I never learned how to make
