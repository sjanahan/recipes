# How to make a walkup livable?
You move into an old building. It's so rustic and chic. It even has exposed brick!
There's likely so much wrong with it. You might be able to see some, but most are invisible.

Five years of living in one has taught me how lots about how to comfortablly live in one. Here's what I've learned.

#### Get an AC installed first thing
Otherwise you will just be miserable all summer.

#### Install a Front Door Pest Sweep and Holes Plugged by Exterminator company
When I moved in, there were definitely already mice. I observed they either came under the front door or through holes beneath the bathroom vanity. I couldn't get my landlord to send one until I saw a rat come underneath my front door one day. Press for this proactively!

#### Hang bike on the wall
A bike on the sidewalk gets stripped for parts. A bike on the ground costs you roughly $30/month (4 square feet) in space. If you hang in on the wall, you solve for the integrity and cost issues.

Matter fact, while you're at it, hang these up too
1. magnet for knives knifes
1. vacuuum
1. holder for paper towels
1. hooks for your coats
1. hooks for your backpacks
1. hooks for your shower towels
1. hooks for your masks because we live in the Rona

#### Turn one of your windows into a closet
My apartment only had one closet and it was in the bedroom. There was nowhere to store the dry lentils, rice, spices, and sauces. I installed some shelves into the brick in a window kitchen for this.

#### Double check how many appliances are on one circuit
One day I turned on the kettle in the kitchen and hearing clicking and popping from the breaker box. I let the management company know and they sent someone to switch the circuit breakers. While figuring out which breaker mapped to what outlet, we realized that the stove, fridge, dishwasher, kitchen counter, microwave were all on the same **20A** circuit. All those appliances if on at the same time draw **82A**, and the stove draws **40A** alone. I let the management company know and they dismissed it as unneccesary to fix it. Five days later while I was cooking, the plug on the stove outlet sparked and melted in the wall. Every time I flipped the breaker for that circuit I could reproduce a spark.

This issue took 8 days to fix and I couldn't cook for the entirety. I had moved the microwave to the living room. The fridge was running on an extension cord to the living room so that the food didn't go bad. My management company did not grant any abatement for this.

#### Toilet started leaking urine and feces from the bottom
And after the first time they fixed it, they did a fix against the plumber's recommendation and it broke 8 months later. You really have to oversee the fixes otherwise they might cut corners. I didn't document the first plumber's recommendation and the management company denied ever getting his recommndation. Lesson learned - document everything yourself.

#### Make sure your windows open and stay up
If they are not staying up, that also means that they will leak air when it's cold. Get that fixed before winter and the boiler breaks (because it eventually will). One night it got down to 34 degrees in here.

#### Get some window screens installed
Technically, landlords are not responsible for window screens in NYC. On top of that, my apartment has no ventilation systems because it's old. If you open the windows flies will get in. I had to pay a window company $160 for 2 screens. Well worth it to air the place out without flies.

## Result
If you employ some of these tips proactively, you can avoid sad time where your apartment is less than livable and your management company is in breach of the Implied Warranty of Habitability or you feel like you need more space.
