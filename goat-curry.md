### Why this Dish?
Goat curry reminds me of Amma's house. We even eat this on Thanksgiving instead of turkey usually with Appam and coconut sambal.

### Tools
1. Large, heavy-bottomed pan
1. Wooden spoon
1. Meat cleaver (big knife)

1. one black cardamom
1. juice of one lime
1. 5 curry leaves
1. 1 tsp five spice(mustard seeds, cumin, fennel, fenugreek seeds - sell at patel bros, roast with raw rice) ground up

The above is for 1 pound, I usually do 6-7 pounds at a time (whole back goat leg)

2. Cube goat small and set aside
